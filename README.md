# Introduction to caching with Next.js

This repo works alongside the blog post I wrote ["Introduction To Caching With Next.js"](https://blog.dennisokeeffe.com/blog/2021-09-30-introduction-to-caching-with-nextjs).

## Quickstart

```s
# Terminal 1
$ redis-server
# Terminal 2
$ npm run dev
```

Read through the blog post to understand what to comment out at varying stages to see different forms of caching in action.
